# Never Modify Working Endpoints

When fixing a bug for a specific page, **never modify an existing endpoint that other pages depend on**. Modifying shared endpoints causes regressions in unrelated areas.

## Rule

- If an endpoint is broken for a page, **create a new endpoint** rather than editing the existing one.
- This applies even if the fix seems safe -- the risk of breaking other consumers is not worth it.
- More endpoints is acceptable. Fewer bugs is the priority.

## Example

```
# BAD: Editing GET /tenants to fix the walkthrough edit page
#      breaks the tenants list page that was already working

# GOOD: Create GET /tenants/for-walkthrough or similar
#        dedicated to the walkthrough edit page's needs
```
